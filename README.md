Forking the Repo : A technique used to store a repo belonging to someone other user. Why? Because we can only clone our repos. In order to clone any foreign repos, we need to fork and then clone them. 
Steps involved:
1. Select a target repo for forking.
2. Navigate to the fork button in that repo.
3. Fork it to the target account.
4. Clone it using git bash or using desktop ( a simple download to the local system)
